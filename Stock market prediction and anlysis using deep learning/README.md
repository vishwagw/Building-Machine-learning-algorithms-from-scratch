Usage of ML and AI for stock market is one of the major part in ML algorithms in modern days. So, I did decide to create a ML model for stock market analysis and forecasting.
To create this project I am going to build a Deep learning model. A deep learning model is a More advanced machine learning algorithm that use a Neural Network as its fundamental acrhitecture. 

# what is a stock market ?
Stock market is a place where people comes to buy and sell stocks(stocks of a company/institute).share market serves as a platform for investors to participate in the growth of companies, diversify their portfolios, and potentially earn returns on their investments.It is also known as equity or share market. 

Stock market is a very voiatile field where prices go up and down consistantly. so, it is a high risk investment field. 
For the human brain it is very complex task to analyse all te data about a company and comes to conclusions or make decisions. so, doing it in many companies is much more harder. But computers that are working with ML algorithms have so much power that can perform sries of complex tasks easily and faster. 

# Libraries
I am using following libraries 
1. numpy
2. pandas
3. matplotlob
4. seaborn
5. plotly


# dataset :
In this deep learning model i have used datasets from following companies.
1. google
2. microsoft
3. apple
4. amazon

The dataset can be found inside the dataset folder.

# Part 1 - Market analyse
first notebook contains the model for analysing the current market by input data sets. This analysis will help us to understand the data structure and current market situation.
