This project is created to understand the machine learning algorithms from scratch.
In this project I am going to build a simple linear reggression algorithm. 

1. Linear regression algorithm
The linear regression is a method is actually more than 200 years old. 
Linear regression assumes a linear or straight line relationship between the input variables (X) and the single output variable (y). More specifically, that output (y) can be calculated from a linear combination of the input variables (X). When there is a single input variable, the method is referred to as a simple linear regression.

2. Calculate the covariance:
The covariance of two groups of numbers describes how those numbers change together. Covariance is a generalization of correlation. Correlation describes the relationship between two groups of numbers, whereas covariance can describe the relationship between two or more groups of numbers. Additionally, covariance can be normalized to produce a correlation value.

3. Make predictions:
this is the final output of using linear regression algorithm. The simple linear regression model is a line defined by coefficients estimated from training data. Once the coefficients are estimated, we can use them to make predictions.


# Case Study: Swedish insuarance case study:

This dataset is belong to a swedish insuarance company publicaly available data. 
The task is to build a simple linear regression model based on this data set.
