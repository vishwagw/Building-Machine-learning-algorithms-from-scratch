In this project, we are going to create a simple ML algorithm on Python programming language.
For ML algorithms, we typically use jupyter notebooks(.ipynb).
1. Sci-kit learn - 
Sci-kit learn is a package suite that can be installed in your computer using followin command line.
   pip install scikit-learn
This is one of the best python library packages to create ML algorithm.
from this package, we can import datasets. there are several sample datasets we can use for.  

then we must oragnize the dataset first.so, we have to load the input data variable. then we have to identify other variables as mentioned. 
then we can print the variables and have a first look on the data.
